DB host preference and SQLite fallback (development)

Context
- When running Django directly on Windows, the Docker hostname `db` is not resolvable outside the Docker network. If the settings try `db` first, Django may fall back to SQLite even when the MariaDB container is healthy.

Development behavior (patched)
- The development settings prefer MariaDB on `127.0.0.1:3306` first.
- If environment provides `DB_HOST`, it is tried next.
- Then `localhost` is attempted.
- If none are reachable, Django falls back to SQLite (development-only) to avoid blocking local work.

How to use
- Ensure the MariaDB container is running and publishing port `3306`.
- Run migrations and use development settings explicitly:
  - `python manage.py showmigrations voting --settings=votebem.settings.production; python manage.py migrate --settings=votebem.settings.production`
- Start the server with development settings:
  - `python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000 --settings=votebem.settings.production`

VSCode launch option
- Use the "VSCode: Run Django (development, auto-migrate)" launch configuration. It runs migrations first, then starts the server on `127.0.0.1:8000` with `votebem.settings.production`.

Troubleshooting
- If migrations still fall back to SQLite:
  - Confirm the container exposes `3306` to the host.
  - Verify credentials match `.env.local`.
  - Check firewall rules for local `3306`.
  - Try `python manage.py migrate --settings=votebem.settings.production` manually and inspect errors.
