Staff-only enforcement for /gerencial/

Summary
- A new middleware `votebem.middleware.StaffOnlyGerencialMiddleware` centrally
  enforces that every URL under `/gerencial/` is accessible only to authenticated
  staff users.

Behavior
- Unauthenticated or non-staff access is redirected to `/admin/login/` with a
  `next` parameter pointing to the originally requested URL.
- Authenticated staff users proceed normally to the requested view.

Setup
- Registered middleware in settings (base.py) immediately after
  `django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware`.

Notes
- Using the admin login strengthens the staff-only policy for administrative
  paths.
- Future routes under `/gerencial/` are automatically covered.
